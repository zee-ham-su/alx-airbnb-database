# Database Normalization Analysis

## Objective

Ensure the database schema is in Third Normal Form (3NF).

## Current Schema Analysis

### 1. User Table

- In 3NF
- No transitive dependencies
- All non-key attributes depend on the primary key (user_id)

### 2. Property Table

- In 3NF
- No transitive dependencies
- All non-key attributes depend on the primary key (property_id)

### 3. Booking Table

- In 3NF
- No transitive dependencies
- All non-key attributes depend on the primary key (booking_id)

### 4. Payment Table

- In 3NF
- No transitive dependencies
- All non-key attributes depend on the primary key (payment_id)

### 5. Review Table

- In 3NF
- No transitive dependencies
- All non-key attributes depend on the primary key (review_id)

### 6. Message Table

- In 3NF
- No transitive dependencies
- All non-key attributes depend on the primary key (message_id)

## Normalization Steps

No additional normalization steps are required as all tables are already in Third Normal Form (3NF). The current schema satisfies the following conditions:

1. It is in First Normal Form (1NF):
   - All attributes contain atomic (indivisible) values
   - There are no repeating groups

2. It is in Second Normal Form (2NF):
   - It is in 1NF
   - All non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key

3. It is in Third Normal Form (3NF):
   - It is in 2NF
   - There are no transitive dependencies (non-key attributes depending on other non-key attributes)

## Conclusion

The current database schema is well-designed and already in Third Normal Form (3NF). No further normalization steps are necessary. This design eliminates data redundancy and ensures data integrity.
